## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
### Customer Churn Prediction with Spark
Customer retention is critical for a thriving business. When we are enjoying the digital services with one-click-to-subscribe, companies are pulling hairs out because someone just took one click to quit. If we can identify which users are at-risk to churn, then the business can take action and potentially make them stay.

In this project we will predict users that are at-risk to churn for Sparkify. Sparkify is a music streaming service in the Udacity universe. Just like Spotify, users can choose free tier subscription with ads or paid tier without ads. We will first analyze the data on a smaller subset (128MB), then deploy the pipeline to cloud services like AWS EMR to tune selected models with the full dataset (12GB).
